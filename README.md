## Tooling
I am trying my best to keep things as simple and bare-bones as possible here, therefore trying to keep folks from getting stuck in the weeds of setup, etc. 

In this project we are currently using:
- Ruby
- Cucumber / Capybara / Rspec

### Setup
- Clone this repo
- cd into the base directory and run `bundle install` (make sure all dependencies are installed and nothing bombed out!)
